# Project 1:Web-Stack-Implementation (LAMP STACK) in AWS EC2

Before going into the project details, I'd like to define a web stack.
## What is a Web Stack?
A Web stack is the collection of software required for Web development. It consists of an operating system (OS), a programming language, database software and a Web server. An example of a web stack is LAMP, but there are other different stacks as well and they are touched on below.
- **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- **LEMP** (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- **MERN** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- **MEAN** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS

As with software development, web development follows Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## What is SDLC?
SDLC is a systematic process of building softwares that helps ensure the quality and correctness of the software that is built.
There are 7 phases in an SDLC process and they are listed as follows;
- **Phase 1: Requirement collection and analysis**
- **Phase 2: Feasibility study**
- **Phase 3: Design**
- **Phase 4: Coding**
- **Phase 5: Testing**
- **Phase 6: Installation/Deployment**
- **Phase 7: Maintenance**

## Project Objectives:

- Become adept on the Linux Terminal.
- Deepen understanding of Web Stacks and understand the differences between the various Web stacks. 
- Increase knowledge of AWS platform and offerings that can be used to implement Web stacks.
- Implement a LAMP stack in AWS.

## Getting Started:

This project will be utilizing the AWS Cloud platform. Therefore, to get started on this project, one must have an AWS account. You can select any plan that fits your needs. I used the Free Tier Plan for this project. Click/Copy and paste the following link for a video on how to register for an AWS account: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3WLJ_0hnOU

The following steps will explain how to create your first Instance.

1. Sign-in to your AWS Cloud Account as the Root user.
